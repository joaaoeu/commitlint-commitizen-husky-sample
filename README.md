You may also add the description below in the project README to help new people.

# Commit Message

In this project we use [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to ensure good commit messages üòÜ

We follow the [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional) rules. Any suggestion are welcomed though.

You may commit as usual just following the rules or if wanna help use the [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) just running `yarn cz` or `npm run cz`!

Before each commit [Husky üê∫](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will check your changes and will fix some ESLint and Prettier errors or in your commit message, and alert you if has any trouble.
